# 4K Updater/Launcher
A self-installable script that updates and launches 4K Video Downloader for Ubuntu-based GNU/Linux distributions.

## Usage/Installation
After cloning or downloading/unziping, give the .sh file executable permisions, and run it.
You can do it from the terminal like this:
> wget `https://github.com/hk0O7/4K_UpdateLaunch/archive/master.zip` && unzip master.zip && cd 4K_UpdateLaunch-master && chmod +x ./4K_UpdateLaunch.sh && ./4K_UpdateLaunch.sh

On the first start, it will ask you to install it. If you do, you can later remove the .sh file you downloaded.
To uninstall it, open a terminal and type `/opt/4klauncher/4K_UpdateLaunch.sh delete`. This script does not take any other arguments.
